# FREE AS IN MUSIC: A MANIFESTO ON FREE MUSIC

The previous version of my website had all my scores available to download for free, but kept behind an email wall. This wasn't because I didn't want people to download my music, but because I felt the importance of being aware of who was looking at my scores outweighed the importance of making them freely available. I have now changed my mind about this: mainly for political reasons, but also because actually very few people seemed to download my music (the online marketing legend that each click loses 50% of your audience may have been true in this case).

Music should be available to everybody, and as easy as possible to hear and peruse. When I started out performing contemporary music with my friends, I wanted to do pieces by famous composers, but most of them make it very hard to get their music. If a musician ever decides they want to try and learn my music, I want them to be able to start sightreading it five seconds later! It goes without saying that I would still really love to hear from you if you are looking at my music or playing it, but I no longer wish to make it a necessity.

So basically, here are the very basics of what i mean when I say my music is free. I'm using the word "free" in the sense it's used in the software world, and my ethos has been heavily informed by open source software (as well as many years of pirating). I am flitting between different licenses, but in general (and speaking non-legally), this is what I mean:
1. All scores that I have not withdrawn are available to download, free of charge.
2. Where I have had time, all performance materials are available to download, free of charge. Where they are not available, please ask and I will get them to you.
3. Where performances happen in venues which are registered for royalties, I will receive royalties as I am registered with IMRO. However, I also give my permission for the use of my music for unlicensed performances.
4. You are free to make derivative works from my music (in any context). 
5. I don't personally care hugely about attribution, but I think other people in music will, so I would encourage you to work within the cultural norms around attribution in the context you are working in.
5. Where source code (e.g. Max Patches) is provided, its license can be assumed to be a CC0 open source no attribution license. Attribution is welcome if you wish, but I am happy for you to use any of my code in any context. The only exception is when I have re-used code by other people (which will be mentioned) in which case it should be used under the terms of its existing license. 
6. If use is in a professional or commercial context (e.g. a professional orchestra or ensemble, or use in a commercially released film or advertisement), I would appreciate being paid at the going rate.
7. I will be disappointed if my music is used to further or embellish neoliberal, authoritarian or fascist causes but I do not believe it is my right as the artist to set boundaries over who can use my work. 
8. Material in general is provided as is, and I give no guarantees that I will fix errors or respond to questions: but please, if stuff doesn't work in a piece and you can't get in touch with me, feel free to come up with a solution yourself.



There are certain materials which can't be given for free: some of these exceptions are for reasons of morality or good faith, others for reasons of legality. Speaking of the latter, I don't take the laws on copyright very seriously: you will see this both within my music itself (my music is, in many cases, probably illegal) and in my attitude to piracy in general. I believe copyright law as it stands is not in the best interests of artists: it greatly benefits those who have already amassed power and wealth, and while artists can make money from royalty payments, it is necessary for them to undertake a great deal of administrative work in order to earn this money. In many cases, I am happy to skirt around the law here, but if I am worried I may get in trouble for sharing a piece, I may not share it.

The other reasons I take more seriously: there may be works where I am only the part-owner and where the other owners may not agree with my approach; for these works I retain any claim to copyright which is deemed to be mine. There are recordings which embarrass the performers or which they would prefer I did not possess, or where they have requested a time-bound embargo, and I will not share those at all (other than to trusted ears in private). 

Finally (a big category, for now), there is work where the digital materials, especially Max patches, are in too unpolished a state to share with the public, or where the patches are obsolete. In these cases, I will try to make it clear if the material is obsolete. In the cases of obsolete Max patches, a starting point for performance would be to get in touch with me: it's quite possible that a later patch by me might be possible to adapt in order to perform the piece, and in some cases I may be willing to implement the patch in a modern version.
