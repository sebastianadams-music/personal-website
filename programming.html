<div class="content">

<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Much of my artistic output over the past few years has involved a significant amount of computer programming. I have 10 years of experience using the Max MSP visual programming language, with specialisms in the <a target="_blank" href="https://bachproject.net">Bach</a>real-time composition/notation library (including an understanding of lisp-like linked lists) and the Jitter real-time video software included as part of Max.
</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My skills with Max were recently developed by undertaking the intensive Cursus for composers at IRCAM. I can also write JavaScript and Python. I am largely self-taught with these languages, although i did a remote Stanford Code In Place course in 2021. </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The works page of this website was written by me, creating a backend using Google Firestore and a front-end which uses JavaScript to create complex filtering, populating the page from my database and allowing simple text searching etc. </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Most of my code is written for myself, so it is often a proof-of-concept rather than production-ready software. But I do contract work from time to time. </p>
<h3>Some examples of my code:</h3>
<div class="indented">
    <p>    <a target="_blank" href="https://stolenmusic.org/ircam">https://stolenmusic.org/ircam</a>
        - my IRCAM project presented through a complex interactive web page</p>
    <p>    <a target="_blank" href="https://sebastianadams-music.github.io/ghost-box/">ghost-box</a>
        - emulates an auto-scanning FM radio using web radio stations: use this to find ghosts</p>
    <p>    <a target="_blank" href="https://sebastianadams-music.github.io/webradio-shuffler/">Web Radio Shuffler</a>
        - shuffles and crossfades a huge database of web radio stations to create a Cageian browser performance</p>
    <p>    <a target="_blank" href="https://sebastianadams-music.github.io/radio-time-travel/">Radio Time Travel</a>
        - simply finds random web radio stations and does a beautiful HTMLMediaElement time stretch on it</p>
    <p>    <a target="_blank" href="https://sebastianadams-music.github.io/youtube-cues/">YouTube Cue Player</a>
        - crossfades YouTube videos from a list inputted by the user (could be used as a graphic score)</p>
